## Introduction

A web service or APIs (Application programming interfaces) it's designed for machine-machine communication communication
over a network with interoperability. Among the two most popular web service groups, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
is a kind of old-fashioned web service that is still used in application development contexts at the enterprise level.
The transport mechanism of SOAP services is either HTTP or MQ but the format of the request and the response should be SOAP XML.
These are the key things of SOAP services and now we will look at how we can implement simple SOAP services using the
contract-first approach with Spring Boot
